Ingredients
2 lb. (7 medium) unpeeled zucchini, coarsely grated
4 large eggs
1 teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon black pepper
1 bunch scallions, white parts and 1 inch of the greens, thinly sliced 
	(about 1 cup)
1 cup plain bread crumbs
1 tablespoon minced garlic
½ cup chopped parsley
½ cup olive oil for frying

Instructions
Place the grated zucchini in a colander to drain for 30 minutes 
	(If zucchini is firm, you won’t get much water).
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mix all other ingredients except for the oil. 
	Add the drained zucchini and mix well.
Heat oven to 200 degrees F.
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in each of 2 large skillets, over medium heat. 
	When hot, after about 3 minutes, 
		drop ¼ cup of the batter onto 4 spots on each skillet 
	(mine are pretty and round because I used a round, 
	shallow measuring cup to scoop the mixture out).
Cook until golden on the bottom, about 4 minutes. 
	Turn and cook on the other side, about 2 minuets more.
Repeat with 2 more batches, 
	wiping the skillets with paper towels and 
	adding more oil as needed. Keep the prepared cakes 
		in the warm oven while you cook more batches.
